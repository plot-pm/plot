# Two monitors watch the agent

> One watches the process and one watches the desk, on cadences that cannot be shared — so a dead agent, an idle process, and finished work with no PR are all reported instead of discovered.

## Changelog

- A dispatched agent is watched by two monitors — one on its process, one on its desk — so finished work with no PR, an idle process and a dead agent are reported on the board's attention surface rather than found by someone looking.

<!-- Board impact: YES — new attention entries. The pulse contract gains fields;
     no existing value changes. Rebuild the artifact. -->

## Motivation

**Twice in one session, finished work sat on a branch with no PR, and nothing
noticed.**

| | how it died | what was there |
|---|---|---|
| `feature/the-ports-have-adapters` | exited cleanly | 4 commits, 7 ports, 261 tests green |
| `feature/the-domain-agrees-with-production` | process alive, agent gone | 4 commits, corpus tier, 13/13 green |

**Both were found because a person asked.** Nothing in Plot reports *this branch
has finished work and no review* — not the scan, not the board, not the worker
state.

**The second one is the sharper case, because the process lied.**
Measured 2026-08-30: **50 minutes elapsed, 0.01s CPU**, children `bash` only.
The pid was alive, so every check that asks *is a worker running?* said yes. Had
the answer been trusted, that work would still be sitting there.

**The signals already exist; nothing asks them on a cadence and nothing reports
the answer.**

- `plot-worker-state.sh` knows eight states and refines `finished` by the tree
- `plot_worker_activity()` samples subtree CPU over 0.4 s and returns
  `working` / `idle` — the exact signal that would have caught the stall
- `attention.ts` is already the surface for *this needs you*

**What is missing is the middle: something that asks regularly, compares this
answer with the last, and speaks when the comparison is bad.** A single reading
cannot distinguish a worker thinking from a worker gone; two readings, minutes
apart, can.

## Design

### It observes; it does not act

**The monitor writes attention entries and changes nothing else.** It does not
kill a process, open a PR, reap a worktree or restart an agent — every one of
those is a judgement with a blast radius, and `plot-reap.sh` and
`plot-dispatch.sh` already own them behind their own refusals.

**That boundary is what makes it safe to run continuously.** A watcher that can
only report is one nobody has to supervise.

### Two monitors, because there are two subjects

**A WorkerMonitor and an AgentMonitor, and the split is not stylistic.**
CLAUDE.md settles it for new code: *"a state answering what is the process
doing? goes on the worker; one answering what does this agent owe, or still
hold? goes on the agent."* The findings divide exactly along that line, and
they divide by **what they sample**:

| monitor | samples | cadence | answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WorkerMonitor** | the process table | seconds | is this process doing anything? |
| **AgentMonitor** | the desk and the host | minutes | does this agent still owe something? |

**They cannot share a cadence, which is the practical reason they are two.**
CPU delta is meaningless unless sampled close together — `plot_worker_activity()`
uses 0.4 s. Whether a branch has a PR is a host round trip, and asking it every
few seconds would be the rate problem this repository already measured at 127
git processes per scan. One subject wants tight sampling of a cheap fact; the
other wants occasional sampling of an expensive one.

#### WorkerMonitor — what the process is doing

| finding | measurement |
|---|---|
| **idle** | pid alive, CPU delta zero across consecutive samples |
| **gone** | pid dead |

**`idle` is deliberately not called `stalled`.** The spec already uses that word
for an **Agent** fact — *"exited 0, unlanded work, no PR"*
([DESIGN-agent.md](../stories/the-master-agent-holds-the-fleet/DESIGN-agent.md)) —
and an earlier draft of this plan reused it for a live process with no CPU.
Those are different states with different remedies: a `stalled` agent has work
to rescue, an `idle` worker may simply be waiting on a network call. Reusing the
name would have put a process fact on the agent side, which is the exact
confusion CLAUDE.md's rule exists to prevent.

#### AgentMonitor — what the agent owes

| finding | measurement |
|---|---|
| **owes a review** | tree clean, commits ahead of the default branch, no PR |
| **owes an answer** | a `PLOT-BLOCKED*` marker in the tree |
| **holds unlanded work** | uncommitted or unpushed changes in the tree |

**Each is a measurement, not a judgement** — the same discipline `plot-reap.sh`
applies to its five refusals. *"Owes a review"* is three facts anded together,
and every one is checkable by a script.

#### The two measured cases need both

`the-ports-have-adapters` is an **AgentMonitor** finding: the worker exited
correctly, and what was wrong was the debt it left. `the-domain-agrees-with-production`
is a **WorkerMonitor** finding first — 50 minutes at 0.01s CPU, while the pid
said running — and becomes an AgentMonitor finding the moment that process is
ended. **A single monitor would have had to sample the host every few seconds to
catch the first, or wait minutes to catch the second.**

### The cadence, and why it is not the pulse

**The board pulses every 5 s; the monitor samples far slower.** A stall is only
visible over minutes — CPU delta across two samples 0.4 s apart says whether a
process is busy *now*, which is noise on its own. What identifies a stall is
*idle across successive samples while the tree has not changed*.

**So the monitor keeps the previous answer.** That is the one piece of state
here, and it is derived rather than recorded: lose it and the next sample
rebuilds it, at the cost of one interval's delay.

### Attaching, and why it is explicit

**`plot-dispatch.sh` attaches both monitors when it starts a worker.** The agent
already has a manifest and a worktree; the monitors are the third thing the
dispatcher sets up, and they die with the agent.

**A hand-made worktree gets none**, and that is deliberate. Attaching to
everything would mean watching worktrees nobody dispatched — the population
`plot-dispatch.sh` already refuses to reason about, because they carry no claim
and follow no naming.

## Slices

### Watching the worker (Branch: feature/the-worker-monitor-samples-the-process)

The WorkerMonitor: `idle` and `gone`, sampled from the process table on a tight
cadence, with the previous answer kept so `idle` needs two readings rather than
one. Built on `plot_worker_activity()` rather than beside it.

**Done when** a single idle sample reports nothing, two consecutive idle samples
over an unchanged tree report `idle`, a tree that changed between samples resets
the comparison, a dead pid reports `gone`, and the monitor makes no host call at
all.

**That last clause is the one that keeps the cadences apart.** A WorkerMonitor
that asks the host has become an AgentMonitor with a fast loop, and the rate
problem follows.

### Watching the agent (Branch: feature/the-agent-monitor-reads-the-desk)

The AgentMonitor: `owes a review`, `owes an answer`, `holds unlanded work`, read
from the desk and the host on a slow cadence. Built on `plot-worker-state.sh`
and `plot-pr-merged.sh`.

**Done when** each of the three findings is individually triggerable in a test,
`owes a review` fires on a branch with commits and no PR and does NOT fire once
a PR exists, and nothing in it writes.

### Reporting (Branch: feature/the-monitor-reaches-attention)

The findings become attention entries.

**Done when** an `owes a review` branch appears on the attention surface, the
entry names the branch and what to do, it clears when the PR is opened, and a
WorkerMonitor `idle` finding is distinguishable from an AgentMonitor one in the
entry itself.

### Attaching (Branch: feature/dispatch-attaches-a-monitor)

`plot-dispatch.sh` starts a monitor alongside each worker.

**Done when** a dispatched agent gets both monitors without the operator asking,
a hand-made worktree gets neither, and `--dry-run` names which monitors it would
attach to which worktree.

## Notes

**This does not replace reading the board.** It changes what the board can tell
you: today a finished-no-PR branch is indistinguishable from one still being
worked on, and after this it is not.

**The two measured cases are the acceptance test.** If the monitor had been
running, `the-ports-have-adapters` would have reported `finished, no PR` within
one interval of the worker exiting, and `the-domain-agrees-with-production`
would have reported `idle` after two samples — and, once that process was
ended, `owes a review` from the other monitor. Neither needed a person to ask.

**Open: what the master agent does with a report.** Reporting to the board is
this plan; an agent that acts on the report — restarting, reaping, opening the
PR — is the next question, and it needs the controller
([`the-controller-answers-every-asker`](2026-08-30-the-controller-answers-every-asker.md))
to ask through. Deliberately not here: a watcher that acts is a different risk
from one that reports.
